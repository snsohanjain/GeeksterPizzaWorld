            USPizza is all about quality you can trust. As one of the original
            founding Pizza brands and the 3rd largest Pizza chain in India, our
            sole mission is making the freshest, tastiest and funnest Pizza
            around. Our classic pan pizza will always be a fan favourite, with a
            soft and chewy crust perfectly balancing out the healthy tomato
            puree and mozzarella - cheddar blended cheese. Our authentic Italian
            crust for those who would prefer a light and airy crust to more
            fully enjoy the toppings. Thin, light and delicious. Our newest
            addition of Puree sauces will blow your mind. Chose between a spicy
            buffalo, sweet bbq, tangy chipotle can creamy makhni to perfectly
            compliment your toppings and crust. Our suggestions of combinations
            might be helpful but ultimately the power lies with you.

          <br />
          <p>
            Contrary to industry standard strategy, USPizza, since 1996, has
            been committed to growing our brand slowly and steadily. Every
            outlet is carefully selected on strict criteria. To be a USPizza
            franchisee is a privilege unto itself. The same commitment to
            product and service perfection we practice is expected from our
            partners. Our product is standardised across the Nation, supported
            by a robust supply chain providing all the ingredients required to
            perfectly craft our Pizza. Our outlets are designed by leading
            architects to reflect our philosophy of being open and inviting,
            while putting our customer comfort on priority. Everywhere we go, we
            hear ‘Your pizza is the tastiest pizza around, why aren’t you open
            in my location’. The answer is simple, every outlet opened is a
            promise to our customer, and not one we take lightly.
